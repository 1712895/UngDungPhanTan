Books about life, books that looked from a million angles at life. Books that looked at a million lives. Books that helped me 'figure out' life. I knew a lot about life. I could talk a lot about life. I could even get many people who heard me and agreed that I had it all figured out.\n\nUntil I realized that I knew a lot about life, but had I been living it?\n\nIt was like taking a hundred pictures of a beautiful sunset using two dozen camera modes and settings, sharing it with friends, winning accolades, approvals and envy - and yet not taking a pause to experience the sunset itself.\n\nI realized the books were my selfies. A pile of evidence to prove that I had experienced something called life. But could the evidence be the experience?\n\nI was eager to study life, but afraid to live it. Books were my gateway to a dimension where I could build my own mental models of the world, find the concepts to justify it and live happily ever after. The more models I could build, the more concepts I could flaunt, the more authors I could cite - the more real the world seemed, the thicker the walls became. I had built my grand personal fortress.\n\nI was absolutely right in my kingdom. And I was absolutely alone.\n\nThere were people surrounding me. But the price of admission was believing in my ideas. Or believing in the idea of 'being open to all ideas'. Or believing in the idea of 'being open to life'.\n\nBecause I could \u2018rationally\u2019 and \u2018logically\u2019 prove why each and every one of my ideas was right - based on the innumerable books I had read and the knowledge I had accumulated.

It was not about the need for my ideas to be right. I knew they were right. :) And hence people who put in similar hours and reached similar conclusions were also right.\n\nIt did not matter what those ideas were, as long as we all agreed to those ideas. It was like prisoners agreeing on the color of the prison walls. Same prisons, \u2018better\u2019 crimes.\n\nWe were all together. We were all right. We were respected.\n\nWe were still alone.\n\nAnd we wondered why we were disconnected.\n\nWhat we did not realize is it is not about how we arrive at our mental models of the world.

Now granted the sample size N=1 isn't what could be viewed as a meta study but biologically we are virtually all the same. The experimenter was strict with his intake and consumed less than was required for his Basal Metabolic Intake. His health markers improved over the duration of his experiment despite eating burgers and fries and twinkies etc thereby showing that in his particular instance that it was the caloric intake or lack thereof that improved his health markers and not the macro nutrient composition and constitution.","like":0,"unlike":0,"Answer":[{"IDUser":{"$oid":"60dd85355cf2404ae46f63b3"},"Answer":"i think about this pic >.<","date":"2021-07-25","like":0,"unlike":0,"Name":"Nguy\u1ec5n H\u00e0 Minh","Avatar":"images\/users\/user-2.jpg","check":true,"img":"images\/uploads\/60fd58963c2756.98405513.jpg"}],"check":true,"img":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"60fd5c96085e00009e002166"},"header":"Should I learn PHP in 2019?

What I feel funny is how some people make fun of it.

If yes, PHP is not good. But we use PHP to present web pages. Given that use, PHP does a really great job at being very maintainable and given you have the understanding of how the web works and what software patterns are - PHP will serve you well for a long long time. By the way, Facebook takes up huge amount of load and it was written using PHP. Right now, they run it on HHVM which is fast and 'open source'. So in case you feel PHP is slow, you can just start using HHVM which runs the PHP code much faster. By the way, right now, PHP7 is the fastest scripting language available in many benchmarks you can find on the web.","like":0,"unlike":0,"Answer":[{"IDUser":{"$oid":"60dd85355cf2404ae46f63b3"},"Answer":"PHP has bad frameworks: Name 10 web frameworks written in node, Ruby, Python etc. and there would be at least 20 to counter them in PHP.
